This is a project made in fulfillment of the MMS 142 (Internet Technologies and Web Development) Group Report on Disruptive Innovation: AI Image Generation and Creative Industries. To summarize, Artificial Intelligence generated art is where artwork is assembled through synthesizing and inferring information demonstrated by machines. It stems from filtered datasets and built-in algorithms that employ AI to yield visual imagery based on text prompts by the user. Thus, *can machines be truly creative? At what point will AI systems begin producing autonomous art that deserves to be called artists in their own right? What are the current forefront AI applications standing as the powerhouses of this new creative style?* 

Just as importantly, after evaluating the fast-growing capacities and user base of the AI-art platforms, which zoomed into public awareness this year (2022), our group report also tried to assess the level of their socio-economic impacts on the creative industries (broadly defined, and not just focused on professional artists), and to take careful glimpses as well on their wider cultural and political impacts, e.g. on how we as societies view art and put a value on works of art, how AI art platforms could be abused in various ways to disrupt social coherence, and so on. By these socio-economic and politico-cultural impacts, we made sure to consider both constructive and disruptive impacts, both short-term and long-term.   

The repository contains the GitHub page's code, project boards (for Content and Website), discussion boards, and a wiki for the detailed report on the topic. Subsequently, this repository includes HTML, Markdown, and CSS to run the webpage. The sections are as follows:
